With the first release 1.0 going well, here's the changes I made to the next release, version 1.1:

- Added some new blog posts (haunted school photoshoot).
- Slightly modified the text on the 'index' page.
- Introduced the 'technical informaition' page, which provides details on how the site was built and how it runs, technically.


Looking torwards the future, I am looking at adding some features including:


- A page to showcase my work, along with some sample images.
- Adjustments to the theme - such as different fonts and maybe a further revamp to the design, at some point.

As always, I like to hear your feedback. Let me know if you have any suggestions / advice.
