This weekend, I went on a photoshoot with the Welsh Photography Events group, where we visited a school that is known to be haunted. I managed to get some great photos, with them being a great venue for them to be in.

Whilst I can't reveal the location quite yet, it was somewhere in England but you couldn't beat the venue - it was a great photoshoot.
