Wow, this has been a long-time in the making, with the first public version 1.0 finally released now after all these months in progress!

I'll be honest - this has taken quite a bit longer than expected, but I think the finished result is worth it. I've been through a significant amount of web frameworks and finally landed at Astro, and I can highly recommend it. The docs on https://docs.astro.build/ have been incredible in-terms of helping me make this website and finally get it published. I'm happy with the system here as it allows me to run a tight-ship here and get any changes made to the site very-quickly.

Furthermore, I can recommend with a high-amount of confidence in the Netlify platform - the ease that sites based in a variety of static generators, including Astro can be deployed to the web and stay updated within a minute to a change being published to a GitHub repository. I was initially skeptical and a fan of running services on my own servers but now I am a convert just because of the ease and speed of making changes to the site.

In terms of what is next for the site - take a look at my other post: https://jtyoung.me/blog/whats-next/
