I recently picked-up a new piece of camera equipment - the newly released Sigma 24-70mm f/2.8 lens, in Sony ‘E’ mount.
\
I don’t often buy new equipment - this has been my first purchase in a couple-of-years, notably my last purchase was another Sigma lens, the 30mm f/1.4 variant; this is an amazing lens and I am still very impressed with it - but I wanted more flexibility that a zoom lens offers.
\
\
This lens may be considered by some as ‘one of the best zoom lenses on the market’, and I’d have to agree with them. Whilst it doesn’t have the same zoom range as some others or maybe even the same visual fidelity that some offer, it provides an incredible balance of both versatility, image quality and price that cannot be beaten, in my opinion.
\
This competes with the Sony 24-70mm GM II, that has the same f-stop and is very comparable on weight and size, but I believe the Sony is in a different segment altogether, being nearly double the price of the Sigma. Whilst it is very good, I can’t recommend it over the Sigma unless you have money to burn or need the absolute maximum quality that this focal length can offer.
\
\
This is a very versatile lens, whilst it is only a 24-70mm focal range (although I’m running it on an APS-C Sony A6400 so is actually 36-105mm), it provides the primary range that is most used often, particularly for portraits.

Take a look at some of the sample photos I have taken below:
