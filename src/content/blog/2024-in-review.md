This will be the final update on this site for the year 2024.

I've had a great 2024, so many things have changed with my career, personal life and my hobbies. Whilst there has also been some struggles during the year overall I would say that it has gone positively for me. Now, I would like to share some of the best images from my hobby work:

The majority of these portrait images were taken during Welsh Photography Events, on their monthly and occasional sub-events in different locations. For the sake of privacy of the locations and models involved, I will not share too many details of the events, including locations or the people involved.

I look forward to 2025, and what comes up next. I’m sure I’ll look back at this post and realize that things-have-changed, but that’s a problem for next year.

From myself and on behalf of jtyoung.me, have a happy new year - here’s to a successful 2025!
