With the first public version finally out there and live, it's already time to be looking forward onto what I can do next.
\
\
First steps will likely be to re-add the page regarding the technical construction of the site.
\
After that, I would be looking to add a section regarding my work and publish some of the best images I have taken. Care will have to be taken on that page to ensure high loading-performance but still have the visual quality when required.
\
\
\
Other than that, I will continue to look towards what I can do on the site and improve further. I will slowly be populating the blog section with content as and when appropriate.
\
If you have any suggestions for content or changes to the site, I would be interested to hear it, please let me know at https://jtyoung.me/contact/ .
